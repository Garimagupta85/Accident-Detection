# Accident-Detection

CCTV surveillance cameras are installed in the majority of roads,highways these days, therefore it generates millions and millions of hours of data, thus, capture a variety of real-world incidents. Road accidents are one of the most severe and fatal incidents, which disrupt the smooth flow of traffic as well leading to wastage of time and resources. Detection of accidents not only help us to save the life of victims, but also helps in reducing traffic congestion.In this, we have proposed a framework for accident detection based on Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Network. The framework localizes and identifies the presence of road accidents in the captured video. The framework contains a time-distributed model which learns both the temporal and spatial features of the video,making the framework more efficient. The proposed approach is evaluated on the data-set, built by obtaining recorded road accident videos from youtube. Results demonstrate the applicability of our approach performs, accident detection and localization effectively.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system
